# Guess-Master

Guess Master

Guess Master is a guessing game where the user must guess a person's birthday or the date of origin of a select object and the game is created in Java. 

The project uses a plethora of key Java concepts such as but not limited to Polymorphism, Inheritance, Overloading, Encapsulation, Abstraction and Overriding.

The game begins in the main menu, where users can select a random entity option or manually pick the entity they wish to guess out of a list. After the user selects an option, they are presented with a photo, name of an entity, place of origin and some background information to create a profile for the user to enjoy.

The user will input dates, and the program will return feedback based on the input data. 

Once the user has input an answer into the program, the program will inform the user of the following action required based on their input. The program can say one of the following; they are indeed correct and congratulate them, or they must retry, and state then will advise the user of which mistake they made, such as they must select an earlier date, a later date, or an appropriate date if the user did not enter a date at all. 

Once the user completes the level, it will display their score for this level, the score in total and the high score logged on the game. The program will ask the user if they would like to play again and if they would like to play again, ask if they would like to select a random entity or manually select from the list.
